## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup (Follow Each Step Carefully)

### **Step 1: Get the Code from GitHub**

**What we're doing**: Downloading our project code to your computer

1. **Open Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac):
   - **Windows**: Press `Windows key + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter

2. **Navigate to where you want the project**:
   ```bash
   # Go to your Documents folder (safe place to put projects)
   cd Documents
   ```

3. **Download the project**:
   ```bash
   # This downloads our entire project to your computer
   git clone https://github.com/Tokelowo/Echo-Project.git
   
   # Enter the project folder
   cd Echo-Project
   ```

**What just happened**: You now have a copy of our project on your computer in your Documents folder!

### **Step 2: Set Up the Backend (The "Server Brain")**

**What we're doing**: Setting up the Python part that handles data and emails

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   ```bash
   # Move into the backend directory
   cd Agent1/django-backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (like a separate workspace for our project):
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment (think of it as a clean workspace)
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   
   **What this does**: Creates a folder called `venv` that keeps our project's Python packages separate from your computer's main Python installation.

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   
   **For Windows**:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   **For Mac/Linux**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Success indicator**: You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line. This means you're now working in the project's environment.

4. **Install required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   # This installs all the Python libraries our project needs
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **What this does**: Reads a list of required software components and installs them. This might take a few minutes.

### **Step 3: Configure Your Environment File**

**What we're doing**: Creating a settings file that tells our system how to work

1. **Create your settings file**:
   
   **For Windows**:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   
   **For Mac/Linux**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the settings file**:
   - **Option A**: Use VS Code: `code .env`
   - **Option B**: Use any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)
   - **Option C**: Right-click the `.env` file and choose "Open with" ‚Üí "Notepad"

3. **Fill in your settings** (replace the placeholder text with the API keys you obtained above):

```properties
# Django Configuration (the web framework we use)
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random-123456789abcdef
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

# Email Configuration (how we send emails)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=apikey
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY_HERE
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@yourdomain.com

# AI Services (for generating reports)
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
# If using Azure AI Foundry, also add:
# AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-azure-endpoint-url-here

# Reddit API (optional - for real customer reviews)
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your-reddit-client-id-here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your-reddit-client-secret-here
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=YourAppName/1.0

# Security keys (generate random strings using commands below)
API_SECRET_KEY=some-random-string-here-make-it-unique
```

**Important Notes**:
- Replace `YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY_HERE` with your SendGrid API key from the steps above
- Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your OpenAI or Azure AI key
- For `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, use an email you've verified in SendGrid
- Reddit keys are optional - the system works without them

### **Step 4: Set Up the Database**

**What we're doing**: Creating a place to store our data (like creating filing cabinets)

```bash
# Still in the Agent1/django-backend folder
# This creates the database structure
python manage.py migrate

# Optional: Create an admin account for yourself
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

**For the superuser**: 
- Choose a username (like: john_smith)
- Enter your email
- Choose a password (write it down!)

### **Step 5: Set Up the Frontend (The Website Interface)**

**What we're doing**: Setting up the visual part that users interact with

1. **Open a NEW command prompt/terminal window** (keep the old one open)

2. **Navigate to the React folder**:
   ```bash
   # From the main Echo-Project folder
   cd React
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   # This downloads all the website components we need
   npm install
   ```
   
   **What this does**: Downloads JavaScript libraries needed for our dashboard interface.

### **Step 6: Start Both Servers**

**What we're doing**: Starting both parts of our system

You'll need **TWO terminal/command prompt windows** open:

**Terminal 1 - Backend Server**:
```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd Agent1/django-backend

# Make sure virtual environment is activated (you should see (venv))
# If not, run: venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (Mac)

# Start the backend server
python manage.py runserver
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend Server**:
```bash
# Navigate to React folder  
cd React

# Start the frontend server
npm run dev
```

**Success indicators**:
- Backend: Should say "Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
- Frontend: Should say "Local: http://localhost:3000"

### **Step 7: Access the Application**

**What we're doing**: Opening our application in a web browser

Open your web browser and visit these addresses:

- **üìä Main Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - This is the main interface where users view intelligence reports
  
- **üîß API Backend**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
  - This shows that the backend is running
  
- **üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Panel**: [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin)
  - Use the superuser account you created to log in here

## üîß How to Generate Required Security Keys

**What these are**: Random strings that keep our application secure

### **Generate SECRET_KEY**:
```bash
# Run this command to generate a secure secret key
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

### **Generate API_SECRET_KEY**:
```bash
# Run this command to generate an API secret
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

**What to do**: Copy the output from these commands and paste them into your `.env` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Problems & How to Fix Them

*Don't panic if something doesn't work! Here are solutions to common issues:*

### **‚ùå Problem: "Port already in use" or "Address already in use"**

**What this means**: Another program is using the same "address" as our application.

**How to fix**:

**For Windows**:
```bash
# Find what's using port 8000
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill the process (replace <PID_NUMBER> with the number you see)
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

**For Mac/Linux**:
```bash
# Kill anything using port 8000
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

**Simple alternative**: Restart your computer and try again.

### **‚ùå Problem: "Module not found" or "No module named..."**

**What this means**: Python can't find the libraries our project needs.

**How to fix**:
1. **Check if your virtual environment is active**:
   - Look for `(venv)` at the start of your command line
   - If you don't see it, run:
     ```bash
     # Windows
     venv\Scripts\activate
     
     # Mac/Linux  
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Reinstall the packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **‚ùå Problem: Database errors or "no such table"**

**What this means**: The database structure is missing or corrupted.

**How to fix**:
```bash
# Delete the old database (don't worry, this is safe in development)
rm db.sqlite3              # Mac/Linux
del db.sqlite3             # Windows

# Create a fresh database
python manage.py migrate

# Create a new admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### **‚ùå Problem: "npm install" fails or package errors**

**What this means**: The JavaScript packages didn't install correctly.

**How to fix**:
```bash
# Clear the cache and start fresh
npm cache clean --force

# Remove old files
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json     # Mac/Linux
rmdir /s node_modules & del package-lock.json  # Windows

# Try installing again
npm install
```

### **‚ùå Problem: "Command not found" (python, npm, git, etc.)**

**What this means**: Your computer doesn't know where to find these programs.

**How to fix**:
1. **Restart your computer** (this often fixes PATH issues)
2. **Reinstall the software** and make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation
3. **For Python specifically**: 
   - Uninstall and reinstall Python
   - ‚úÖ **CRUCIAL**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### **‚ùå Problem: Nothing happens when I visit localhost:3000 or localhost:8000**

**What this means**: The servers aren't running or started incorrectly.

**How to fix**:
1. **Check both terminal windows are still running**
2. **Look for error messages** in the terminals
3. **Restart both servers**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal to stop
   - Run the start commands again
4. **Try different browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
