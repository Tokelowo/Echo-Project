## 🤖 AUTOMATED EMAIL DELIVERY SYSTEM - SETUP COMPLETE! ✅

### 📋 **What Was Fixed:**
The issue was that there was NO automated system running - emails were only sent when manually triggered. Now you have TWO automated options:

### 🔧 **Option 1: Windows Task Scheduler (RECOMMENDED)**
✅ **ACTIVE NOW** - Set up and running!
- **Task Name**: `EchoProject_EmailDelivery`
- **Schedule**: Every day at 9:00 AM
- **Status**: Ready and waiting for next run
- **Next Run**: Tomorrow (7/28/2025) at 9:00 AM
- **Batch File**: `automated_email_delivery.bat`

**To verify it's working:**
```cmd
schtasks /query /tn "EchoProject_EmailDelivery"
```

### 🔧 **Option 2: Continuous Python Scheduler (BACKUP)**
📁 **File**: `continuous_email_scheduler.py`
- Runs continuously in background
- Checks every hour for due emails
- Main delivery at 9:00 AM daily

**To start the backup scheduler:**
```cmd
python continuous_email_scheduler.py
```
