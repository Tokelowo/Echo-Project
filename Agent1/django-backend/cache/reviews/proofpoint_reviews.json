Large org here, 40k+ users, been a Proofpoint customer for 15 years and the directive from new CISO is to move everything to Exchange Online Protection.  We bought E5s for everyone so we have the Microsoft full security stack.  One of the bigger hurdles we are facing is using 365 email encryption as opposed to Proofpoint.

Our tickets system works by setup an exchange forwarding rule(not a rule in outlook) from our internal helpdesk address to their external support email which parses and create a ticket for us.
